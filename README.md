# About

Orbiter is a collection of modules and tools for [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/), originally built for survival, anarchy, and creative/OP.

Everything is organized into five in-game categories:

- **Orbiter Survival** • general purpose and anti-abuse modules
- **Orbiter Vanilla** • modules that only use vanilla mechanics
- **Orbiter Creative/OP** • modules that require Creative mode or operator permissions
- **Orbiter Stupid** • joke / experimental modules (Enable in Meteor Client settings)
- **Orbiter W.I.P** • work in progress modules, usable but still rough around the edges

# Requirements

- [Java](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases) 25 or higher
- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) 0.19.3+
- [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/) for 26.2

# Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/player19425/Meteor-Orbiter/releases) of the mod.
2. Put the `.jar` in your `.minecraft/mods` folder. (varies depending on launcher)
3. Launch the game with Fabric and Meteor Client installed.
4. It should be properly installed by now.

Orbiter can also keep itself up to date: when you join a server or world it checks for a new release and shows you an in-game popup with update / ignore / changelog options, and it can even download and install the new jar for you if you turn that on. Everything lives in Meteor Config → Orbiter, and both toggles are yours to flip (the popup is on by default).

# Modules:

## Combat:

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **Aim Assist Plus** | Aim assist with prediction. Supports silent aim and projectile-based pitch. |

- Command-producing modules use capability detection and bounded queues where supported. Command availability does not prove permission.
- Any damage caused by this Meteor Client Addon is __not__ the fault of the creator of the mod, and responsibility lies solely with the person who performed the action. 
- The only official way to download this mod is [from its github.](https://github.com/player19425/Meteor-Orbiter/releases/latest) Downloading this from any other places is __not__ recommended.
