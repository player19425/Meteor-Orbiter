Everything is organized into four in-game categories:

- **Orbiter Vanilla** • modules that only use vanilla mechanics
- **Orbiter Creative/OP** • modules that require Creative mode or operator permissions
- **Orbiter Stupid** • joke / experimental modules

# Requirements

- [Java](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases) 25 or higher

- Command-producing modules use capability detection and bounded queues where supported. Command availability does not prove permission.
- Any damage caused by this Meteor Client Addon is __not__ the fault of the creator of the mod, and responsibility lies solely with the person who performed the action.
